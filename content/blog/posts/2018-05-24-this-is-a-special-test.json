  "body": "**Mini Programs: the new cool kid in WeChat world**\n\nOver the past year or so, popularity of WeChat Mini Programs have grown at a breakneck speed. The market is currently facing a HUGE demand for development of these neat little native-like apps that live inside China's biggest social network. \n\n> Hmm. Mini programs. Yes, I would love to build one, but the documentation is all in Chinese so...\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAs foreigners in China, and as developers, we obviously want in on this hype. We got ideas, we got clients, we got mad Javascript & web dev skills. As foreigners, however, there's a big problem standing in the way: _language barrier_. Documentation for the WeChat mini program framework, related development tools, and the whole ecosystem is almost entirely in Chinese. The limited amount of English documentation on the subject is either out-of-date, Chinglish-y, or incomplete.\n\n**\"How does this not exist yet?\"**\n\nThis website is to serve as a center for up-to-date English documentation on WeChat mini programs. \n\nThis includes the official documentation from Tencent, as well as translated versions of the documentation for popular Mini Program frameworks such as WePy and mpVue. In addition to documentation, the blog on WXMP.io will also push translated versions of popular articles related to MP development, as well as original English language guides & articles from English speakers in the China dev community."
